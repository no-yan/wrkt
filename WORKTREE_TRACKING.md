## Active Worktrees Status

### 1. `main` (main branch)
- **Status**: Clean âœ…
- **Purpose**: Main integration branch
- **Next Action**: Ready to merge all completed features
- **Pending Merges**: 3 completed feature branches ready

## Planned Worktrees

### 5. `feature-zsh-completion` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: Implement zsh tab completion
- **Dependencies**: Core commands must be stable
- **Priority**: Medium

### 6. `feature-cross-platform-testing` (to be created)
- **Purpose**: Cross-platform testing and compatibility
- **Dependencies**: All core features completed
- **Priority**: Medium

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Complete Active Features âœ… COMPLETED
1. âœ… Complete `feature-auto-setup` - gitignore functionality
2. âœ… Finalize `feature-list-filters` - commit integration tests
3. âœ… Verify `feature-clean-command` completion
4. ðŸ”„ **NEXT**: Merge completed features to main

### Phase 2: New Features (Ready to Start)
1. Create `feature-zsh-completion` worktree
2. Implement tab completion functionality
3. Create `feature-cross-platform-testing` worktree
4. Add comprehensive platform testing

### Phase 3: Integration and Release (Pending)
1. Merge all features to main
2. Final testing and validation
3. Prepare for release

## Commands for Worktree Management

```bash
# Check status of all worktrees
./wrkt list --verbose

# Switch between worktrees (with shell integration)
wrkt switch feature-auto-setup
wrkt switch feature-clean-command
wrkt switch feature-list-filters

# Create new feature worktrees
wrkt add feature/zsh-completion
wrkt add feature/cross-platform-testing

# Clean up completed worktrees
wrkt remove feature-name
```
